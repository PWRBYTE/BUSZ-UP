## 

Business chaining is an important aspect in increasing the profits and for the businesses with the desideratum to burgeon . Chaining the business is often faced by various predicaments , among them the intermediaries in supply of materials and the intelligence in deciding the next location in the chain are some portions to throw light on. These problems can be addressed by technologies like that of Blockchain and Machine Learning . Blockchain , a new paradigm in transaction execution is used to remove the dependance on the intermediaries which will drastically reduce the cost of the business . The decentralized architecture and smart contracts are some of the notable features of blockchain . With Machine Learning consisting of various clustering algorithms are used to predict the next best location for the new branch in the chain . The business owners will be given the facility to buy materials to start the new branch and hire staffs whoes datas will be stored in . Using mainly K-Means clustering the new branch location will be predicted based on the demographic data and the state in which the business is to be protracted .

## Objectives :

1. Helps businesses with the aim to burgeon by predicting the best locations for the next branch to setup. 

2. The hired employees' data will be stored in the blockchain post setting up the new branch to evade any frauds.

3. A blockchain service will be provided for the aspiring job seekers where they can store their credentials and this blockchain service will be sold to other businesses who want to hire employees while spending minimal time in the authentication and verification of the employee data . Taking down the verification process of 3-4 days or even more to just within minutes.

## Our Idea :

1. The business owner will login and select the state in which he/she wants to scale the business and open a new branch , based on the demography and distance and some other parameters the few locations will be shown where the new branch can be set up for maximum profit.

2. If the business owner has already set up the new branch then after hiring the employees he/she can store the employees' data throughout his/her term.

3. The blockchain of each employee can be shared between companies and other businesses.
